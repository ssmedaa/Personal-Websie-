            <p style="text-indent:5%; text-align:left; margin-left: 20%; "> Developed a program game based on the the six degree of separation theory of for actor Kevin Bacon, to
            demonstrate the theory that all individuals worldwide are linked through a series of acquaintances with a maximum
            of six connections.Designed and implemented a Python program using IMDb data. The IMDbPY library searches for actors/actress,
            and their films that connects to other actors by navigating through the degrees of separation between them and
            Kevin Bacon. To effectively navigate the graph of actors and their collaborations, the program uses a breadth-first search (BFS)
            algorithm.The program displays the outcome to the user after determining the path, indicating the degree of separation between the two players and showing the intermediary individuals participating in the chain of acquaintances.</p>
           <br>
            <h4 style="text-align: right;"><mark>Chat Application | Socket.io, JavaScript, HTML/CSS </mark></h4>
            <p style="text-indent:5%; text-align:left; margin-right: 30%;">Developed a real-time chat application utilizing Socket.io, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. Enabling seamless
                communication with other users through a connection established on a localhost port.
                Incorporated user information requirements such as username and room code prior to accessing the chat room. Ensured data security in the chat web application by implementing a message deletion feature. Developed a
                mechanism to automatically delete messages once both users exit the room, thus safeguarding user privacy and maintaining data confidentiality.</p>

                <h4><mark>University Database | Java, MySQL</mark></h4>
        
                <p style="text-indent:5%; text-align:left; margin-left: 40%;"> Database system for a university that stores university personal information (ie. university employees, and
                    students).
                     System allows alteration of information by only authorized individuals.</p>

                     <p style="text-indent:5%; text-align:left; margin-right: 40%; ">  Developed a program that allowed students to view all their courses, but also: sort/clean the database,
                        load/write/empty the disk, and remove recorded courses.
                         Program uses pointers to store studentsâ€™ course information and allow students to have the ability to change their
                        transcript records.</p>
